When its creators learnt of this power and the danger it could bring, they sealed it in a sturdy box which prevents the AI from transmitting radio waves to the outside world. It now lives its life as a mechanical bug, only being able to crawl around and snip with its sharp claws."

He typically avoids fighting and wishes for peace in the Technological Singularity."
